Here's a minimal `werf.yaml`. It describes a _image_ named `example` that is based on a _base image_ named `alpine`:

```yaml
project: my-project
configVersion: 1
---
image: example
from: alpine
```

_Base image_ can be declared with `from`, `fromImage` or `fromImageArtifact` directive.

## from and fromCacheVersion

The `from` directive sets the name and tag of a _base image_ to build _from_ stage. If absent, tag defaults to `latest`.

```yaml
from: <image>[:<tag>]
```

On _from_ stage, _from image_ is pulled from a repository and saved in the [_stages cache_]({{ site.baseurl }}/reference/build/stages.html). If _from_ stage is using cache image won't be pulled.

Pay attention, _from_ stage depends on a variable of _from_ directive, not on _from image_ digest or something else.

If you have, e.g., _from image_ `alpine:latest`, and need to rebuild _image_ with the actual latest alpine image you should set _fromCacheVersion_ (`fromCacheVersion: <arbitrary string>`) and delete existent _from image_ from local docker or manually pull it.

If you want always build image with actual latest _from image_ you should automate this process outside of werf and use a particular environment variable for `fromCacheVersion` (e.g., the variable with _from image_ digest).

{% raw %}
```yaml
from: "alpine:latest"
fromCacheVersion: {{ env "FROM_IMAGE_DIGEST" }}
```
{% endraw %}

## fromImage and fromImageArtifact

Besides using docker image from a repository, _base image_ can refer to _image_ or [_artifact_]({{ site.baseurl }}/reference/build/artifact.html), described in the same `werf.yaml`.

```yaml
fromImage: <image name>
fromImageArtifact: <artifact name>
```

If a _base image_ is specific to a particular application,
it is reasonable to store its description with _images_ and _artifacts_ which are used it as opposed to storing the _base image_ in a registry.

Also, this method can be helpful if the stages of _stage conveyor_ are not enough for building an image. You can design your _stage conveyor_.
